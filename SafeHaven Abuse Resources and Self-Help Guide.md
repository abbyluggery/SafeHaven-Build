## Understanding Types of Abuse

SafeHaven recognizes **6 primary types of abuse**. Abuse often occurs in combinations, and recognizing the patterns is critical for safety planning and legal documentation.

### 1. Physical Abuse

**Definition**: The use of physical force that causes or could cause harm, injury, or pain.

**Examples**:
- Hitting, slapping, punching, kicking
- Choking, strangling, or suffocation
- Burning or scalding
- Using weapons or objects as threats or to cause harm
- Restraining, confining, or physically preventing someone from leaving
- Throwing objects at someone
- Pulling hair, biting, scratching
- Denying medical care or medication
- Forcing alcohol or drug use

**Warning Signs**:
- Unexplained injuries (bruises, burns, fractures)
- Injuries in various stages of healing

- Wearing inappropriate clothing to cover injuries (long sleeves in summer)
- Flinching or defensive reactions to sudden movements
- Reluctance to seek medical attention

**Documentation Tips**:

---

### 2. Verbal Abuse

**Definition**: The use of words to cause harm, intimidate, or control another person.

**Examples**:
- Name-calling, insults, put-downs

- Silent treatment as punishment
- Constant interrupting or invalidating

**Warning Signs**:
- Walking on eggshells to avoid outbursts
- Second-guessing yourself constantly
- Feeling like you can't do anything right
- Loss of confidence and self-esteem
- Anxiety around the abuser
- Feeling responsible for their anger

**Documentation Tips**:
- Keep a detailed journal with dates, times, and exact quotes

---

### 3. Emotional/Psychological Abuse

**Definition**: A pattern of behavior that damages self-worth, sense of reality, and emotional well-being through manipulation, intimidation, and control.

**This is one of the most dangerous and underrecognized forms of abuse.**

#### Signs of Emotional Abuse

**Gaslighting** (Making you question your reality):
- Denying events that clearly happened ("That never happened, you're making it up")
- Minimizing your feelings ("You're too sensitive", "You're overreacting")
- Shifting blame to you for their behavior
- Rewriting history to make you the aggressor
- Accusing you of being "crazy" or "unstable"
- Hiding or moving your belongings to confuse you

**Isolation**:
- Cutting you off from friends and family
- Monitoring or controlling phone/email/social media
- Preventing you from working or attending school
- Requiring constant check-ins or location tracking
- Criticizing everyone you care about
- Making it difficult to maintain relationships

**Intimidation**:
- Using looks, gestures, or actions to create fear
- Smashing objects, punching walls
- Destroying your property or sentimental items
- Harming or threatening to harm pets
- Displaying weapons
- Driving recklessly with you in the car
- Threatening suicide if you leave

**Control and Dominance**:
- Making all major decisions without your input
- Treating you like a servant or child
- Defining rigid gender roles
- Dictating what you wear, eat, where you go
- Monitoring all activities and whereabouts
- Excessive jealousy disguised as love

**Degradation**:
- Constant criticism of your appearance, intelligence, abilities
- Mocking your beliefs, culture, or background
- Comparing you unfavorably to others
- Humiliating you in public or private

- Holding affection, money, or children as leverage
- Making you feel guilty for normal needs or boundaries
- "If you loved me, you would..."
- Weaponizing your vulnerabilities

#### Why Emotional Abuse Is So Dangerous

1. **It's invisible**: No physical scars make it harder to recognize and harder for others to believe
2. **It escalates**: Often precedes physical violence
3. **It's cumulative**: Long-term exposure causes severe psychological harm (C-PTSD, anxiety, depression)
4. **It rewires the brain**: Creates learned helplessness and trauma bonding
5. **It's hard to prove**: Courts often don't recognize it without physical evidence

#### Effects of Emotional Abuse

- **Mental health**: Depression, anxiety, C-PTSD, dissociation
- **Physical health**: Chronic stress-related illnesses (headaches, digestive issues, weakened immune system)
- **Cognitive**: Difficulty concentrating, memory problems, confusion
- **Self-perception**: Loss of identity, low self-worth, self-blame
- **Relationships**: Difficulty trusting others, isolation
- **Decision-making**: Paralysis, second-guessing, fear of consequences

#### Documentation Strategies for Emotional Abuse

**Because emotional abuse leaves no physical evidence, documentation is CRITICAL**:

1. **Detailed Journal**:
   - Date, time, location of each incident
   - Exact words spoken (use quotes)
   - Your emotional and physical state
   - Witnesses present
   - Any escalation patterns

2. **Digital Evidence**:
   - Screenshot texts, emails, social media messages
   - Save voicemails
   - Document online harassment or monitoring
   - Use SafeHaven's silent camera for threatening gestures or destroyed property

3. **Pattern Documentation**:
   - Note frequency and escalation
   - Document how it affects daily life (can't sleep, can't eat, anxiety attacks)
   - Track isolation attempts (blocked contacts, prevented outings)

4. **Third-Party Corroboration**:
   - Share incidents with trusted friends/family (creates witnesses)
   - Seek therapy (therapist can testify to your mental state)
   - Medical records for stress-related illness
   - Work records if performance affected

5. **Financial Records**:
   - If economically controlled, document denied access to money
   - Forced job loss or sabotaged employment

---

### 4. Financial Abuse

**Definition**: Controlling a person's ability to acquire, use, or maintain financial resources.

**Examples**:
- Preventing access to bank accounts or money
- Forcing you to account for every penny spent
- Sabotaging employment (making you late, calling constantly)
- Running up debt in your name
- Stealing money or assets
- Refusing to contribute to household expenses
- Forcing you to hand over paychecks
- Controlling all financial decisions

- Unexplained debt or poor credit
- Partner controls all financial information

**Documentation Tips**:
- Copy all financial documents (bank statements, bills, pay stubs)
- Document denied access to accounts
- Screenshot unusual transactions
- Keep evidence of sabotaged employment
- Credit reports showing fraudulent accounts

---

### 5. Sexual Abuse

**Definition**: Any sexual contact or behavior that occurs without consent.

**Examples**:
- Rape or sexual assault
- Coercing or manipulating into sexual acts
- Unwanted touching or sexual contact
- Forcing sex as "obligation" in relationship
- Refusing to use contraception or sabotaging birth control (reproductive coercion)
- Forcing pregnancy or abortion
- Sharing intimate images without consent (revenge porn)
- Using sex as a weapon or punishment (withholding or forcing)
- Minimizing your sexual boundaries
- Criticizing or shaming your body or sexuality

**Important Note**: **Marital rape is a crime in all 50 states.** Being married or in a relationship does NOT imply consent.

**Warning Signs**:
- Fear of refusing sexual advances
- Feeling coerced or pressured
- Injuries to sexual organs or breasts
- STIs when in monogamous relationship
- Forced into degrading sexual acts
- Sexual activity used as currency for basic needs

**Documentation Tips**:
- Seek medical exam (SANE nurse, rape kit if recent)

## Emotional Abuse Identification

### The Emotional Abuse Checklist

**Answer these questions honestly. If you answer "yes" to several, you may be experiencing emotional abuse:**

#### Control
- [ ] Does your partner dictate what you wear, who you see, where you go?
- [ ] Do you need permission to make decisions about your own life?
- [ ] Are you monitored constantly (location tracking, phone checking)?
- [ ] Do you feel like you're walking on eggshells?

#### Isolation
- [ ] Has your partner isolated you from friends and family?
- [ ] Are you discouraged from working, going to school, or having hobbies?
- [ ] Does your partner criticize everyone you care about?
- [ ] Do you feel alone with no support system?

#### Degradation
- [ ] Are you constantly criticized, insulted, or called names?
- [ ] Does your partner humiliate you publicly or privately?
- [ ] Are your accomplishments minimized or mocked?
- [ ] Do you feel worthless or like you can't do anything right?

#### Gaslighting
- [ ] Does your partner deny things they clearly said or did?
- [ ] Are you told you're "too sensitive" or "crazy"?
- [ ] Do you constantly question your own memory or perception?
- [ ] Are your feelings dismissed or invalidated?

#### Intimidation
- [ ] Are you afraid of your partner's anger or reactions?
- [ ] Does your partner destroy property, punch walls, or harm pets?
- [ ] Do threats (explicit or implied) control your behavior?
- [ ] Are weapons displayed or mentioned to frighten you?

#### Blame-Shifting
- [ ] Are you blamed for your partner's abusive behavior?
- [ ] Is everything always your fault?
- [ ] Does your partner refuse to take responsibility for their actions?
- [ ] Are you made to feel guilty for having normal needs?

### Cycle of Abuse (Emotional)

Emotional abuse often follows a predictable cycle:

1. **Tension Building**:
   - Walking on eggshells
   - Minor incidents
   - Anxiety increases
   - Trying to prevent explosion

2. **Incident/Explosion**:
   - Verbal attack, gaslighting, intimidation
   - May involve physical destruction
   - Intense fear or emotional harm

3. **Reconciliation ("Honeymoon")**:
   - Apologies, promises to change
   - Gifts, affection, declarations of love
   - Blaming stress, alcohol, external factors
   - Minimizing the incident

4. **Calm**:
   - Appears normal
   - May feel hopeful
   - Abuse not discussed
   - Until tension builds again

**This cycle reinforces trauma bonding and makes leaving difficult.**

## Understanding DARVO Tactics

### What is DARVO?

**DARVO** is an acronym coined by Dr. Jennifer Freyd (psychologist and researcher) that stands for:

- **D**eny
- **A**ttack
- **R**everse **V**ictim and **O**ffender

**DARVO is a manipulation tactic used by abusers when confronted with their behavior.** It's extremely common in domestic violence, sexual assault, and other abuse situations. Understanding DARVO is critical for survivors because:

1. It helps you recognize when you're being manipulated
2. It validates your experience when you feel confused
3. It prepares you for how abusers respond in legal settings
4. It prevents you from being re-traumatized by the tactic

### The Three Stages of DARVO

#### 1. DENY

**The abuser denies the abuse occurred or denies responsibility.**

**Examples**:
- "That never happened."
- "You're making this up."
- "I don't remember it that way."
- "You're exaggerating."
- "It wasn't that bad."
- "I was just joking."
- "You're too sensitive."

**Purpose**: To make you question your reality and memory (gaslighting component).

---

#### 2. ATTACK

**The abuser attacks your credibility, character, or motives.**

**Examples**:
- "You're crazy/unstable/mentally ill."
- "You're just trying to ruin my life."
- "You're doing this for attention/money/revenge."
- "You're a liar."
- "Everyone knows you're vindictive."
- "You've always been manipulative."
- "You're the one with the problem."

**Purpose**: To discredit you and shift focus away from their behavior.

---

#### 3. REVERSE VICTIM AND OFFENDER

**The abuser claims they are the real victim, and you are the abuser.**

**Examples**:
- "You're abusing ME by making these accusations."
- "I'm the victim here—look what you're putting me through."
- "You hit me first." (when you defended yourself)
- "You're controlling me by wanting to leave."
- "I'm being persecuted."
- "This is a witch hunt against me."

**Purpose**: To confuse observers (family, friends, legal system), gain sympathy, and avoid accountability.

---

### Why DARVO is So Effective

1. **It mimics real victim behavior**: Abusers convincingly play the victim, making it hard for others to discern the truth
2. **It exploits empathy**: People naturally sympathize with someone claiming to be victimized
3. **It confuses the actual victim**: Survivors start doubting themselves ("Maybe I am the problem")
4. **It works in court**: Judges, lawyers, and juries can be fooled by DARVO
5. **It isolates the victim**: When others believe the abuser, the victim loses support

### DARVO in Different Contexts

#### In Private (At Home)
- Used to shut down any attempt to discuss problems
- Makes you afraid to bring up issues
- Reinforces power and control
- Creates confusion and self-doubt

#### In Front of Others (Family/Friends)
- Used to turn your support system against you
- Makes you look unreasonable or unstable
- Recruits "flying monkeys" (people who unwittingly help the abuser)
- Socially isolates you

#### In Therapy (Couples Counseling)
**WARNING: Couples counseling is NOT recommended with an abuser because:**
- Abusers use therapy to learn your vulnerabilities
- DARVO is used to manipulate the therapist
- You may be punished later for things discussed in session
- It gives false hope that abuse can be "fixed" with communication

#### In Legal Settings (Court, Police, CPS)
- Used to avoid criminal charges
- Deployed in custody battles
- Can result in victim being arrested (mutual abuse claims)
- May lead to victim losing custody

## Responding to DARVO

### When It Happens in Private

**Do**:
1. **Recognize it**: Say to yourself, "This is DARVO. I know what happened."
2. **Don't engage**: You cannot reason with someone using DARVO
3. **Document**: Write down what was said immediately
4. **Trust yourself**: Your reality is valid
5. **Reach out**: Talk to a trusted friend or counselor

**Don't**:
1. **Don't try to convince them**: It won't work and escalates the situation
2. **Don't accept blame**: You are not responsible for their abuse
3. **Don't self-doubt**: Trust your memory and experience
4. **Don't isolate**: Reach out for support

---

### When It Happens with Third Parties Present

**Do**:
1. **Stay calm**: Emotional reactions can be used against you
2. **State facts simply**: "That's not accurate. Here's what happened: [brief factual account]."
3. **Provide evidence if available**: "I have text messages showing..."
4. **Redirect to the pattern**: "This is part of a pattern of [abuse type]."
5. **Seek witnesses**: If others saw the incident, ask them to corroborate

**Don't**:
1. **Don't get defensive**: It validates the attack
2. **Don't over-explain**: Keep it factual and brief
3. **Don't attack back**: Maintains your credibility

---

### When It Happens in Legal Settings

**Do**:
1. **Prepare your attorney**: Warn them DARVO will be used
2. **Bring documentation**: Timeline, evidence, witness statements
3. **Stay factual**: Stick to documented facts, not emotions
4. **Highlight the pattern**: Show DARVO is part of the abuse pattern
5. **Use expert testimony**: Therapists, DV advocates can explain DARVO
6. **Request DARVO-aware judge/mediator**: If possible

**Don't**:
1. **Don't assume professionals know about DARVO**: Many don't
2. **Don't react emotionally**: It can be used against you
3. **Don't expect immediate belief**: Be prepared for skepticism

---

### Self-Care When Experiencing DARVO

DARVO is re-traumatizing. It can cause:
- Intense self-doubt
- Depression and anxiety
- Feeling crazy or unstable
- Isolation and hopelessness

**Recovery strategies**:
1. **Validation**: Seek support from DV-informed therapists
2. **Grounding**: Use grounding techniques when you feel gaslit
3. **Journaling**: Write your truth to combat distorted narratives
4. **Support groups**: Connect with other survivors who understand
5. **Education**: Learning about DARVO validates your experience
6. **Boundaries**: Limit contact with the abuser and their allies

---

## Documenting DARVO for Court

### Why Document DARVO?

In legal proceedings (divorce, custody, restraining orders, criminal cases), abusers routinely use DARVO to:
- Avoid consequences
- Gain custody of children
- Portray you as the aggressor
- Discredit your abuse claims

**Documenting DARVO is essential to counter these tactics.**

---

### How to Document DARVO

#### 1. Create a DARVO Timeline

**Template**:
```
Date: [Date]
Context: [What prompted the DARVO—you confronted abuse, filed for divorce, etc.]

DENY:
"[Exact quote of denial]"
Reality: [What actually happened, with evidence]

ATTACK:
"[Exact quote of attack on your character]"
Evidence this is false: [Character references, documentation]

REVERSE VICTIM AND OFFENDER:
"[Exact quote of reversal]"
Reality: [Who the actual victim is, with evidence]

Witnesses: [Anyone who observed the DARVO]
Evidence: [Texts, emails, recordings]
```

**Example**:
```
Date: March 15, 2025
Context: I told him I'm filing for divorce after he broke my phone.

DENY:
"I never broke your phone. You're making this up to make me look bad."
Reality: I have photos of the broken phone, and my friend Sarah heard him throw it.

ATTACK:
"You're crazy and vindictive. You've always been a liar. You're doing this to take my kids away."
Evidence this is false: I have no history of lying. My therapist can attest to my credibility.

REVERSE VICTIM AND OFFENDER:
"I'm the victim here. You're abusing me with these false accusations. You're trying to destroy my life."
Reality: I have documented 47 incidents of his abuse over 3 years, including photos of injuries.

Witnesses: Sarah (friend), Dr. Jones (therapist)
Evidence: Photos of broken phone, medical records of past injuries, incident journal
```

---

#### 2. Collect Evidence of DARVO Patterns

**Save everything**:
- Text messages where abuser denies, attacks, reverses
- Emails with DARVO language
- Voicemails
- Social media posts (screenshot immediately)
- Messages to mutual friends using DARVO

**Create folders**:
- "Deny" folder
- "Attack" folder
- "Reverse Victim" folder

This shows a **pattern**, which is more compelling than isolated incidents.

---

#### 3. Get Third-Party Corroboration

**People who can validate your experience**:
- **DV-informed therapist**: Can testify to your mental state and the impact of DARVO
- **Friends/family**: Who witnessed abuse or DARVO tactics
- **Medical professionals**: Who treated injuries or stress-related illness
- **DV advocates**: Who worked with you and observed the dynamics
- **Coworkers**: If abuse or DARVO affected your work

**Ask them to write statements** including:
- What they observed
- Your credibility and character
- Changes they noticed in you (isolation, fear, injuries)
- Instances where abuser used DARVO

---

#### 4. Document the Context: Abuse First, DARVO Second

**Courts need to understand**:
1. **The underlying abuse** (physical, emotional, financial, etc.)
2. **Your attempts to address it** (confronting, reporting, leaving)
3. **The abuser's DARVO response** to avoid accountability

**Structure your documentation**:
```
INCIDENT 1:
Date: Jan 10, 2025
Abuse: [He punched a hole in the wall next to my head during an argument]
Evidence: [Photo of wall, text to friend immediately after]

CONFRONTATION:
Date: Jan 11, 2025
What I said: "What you did yesterday was abusive and scared me."

DARVO RESPONSE:
Deny: "I didn't punch the wall next to your head. It was across the room."
Attack: "You're exaggerating to make me look bad. You're so dramatic."
Reverse: "I only did that because you were screaming at me. You provoked me."

Evidence of DARVO: [Text message with his response]
```

Repeat for every incident. This shows the **pattern of abuse + DARVO deflection**.

---

#### 5. Highlight DARVO in Legal Filings

**Work with your attorney** to:
- **Name it**: Use the term "DARVO" in filings (many judges now recognize it)
- **Explain it**: Include a brief definition
- **Show the pattern**: Reference your timeline and evidence
- **Request DARVO-aware professionals**: Ask for judges, mediators, or evaluators trained in DV dynamics

**Sample language for court filings**:
```
"Respondent has engaged in a pattern of DARVO (Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim and Offender),
a well-documented manipulation tactic used by abusers. Each time Petitioner has confronted
the abuse or attempted to leave, Respondent has:

1. Denied the abuse occurred (see Exhibit A: text messages)
2. Attacked Petitioner's credibility and mental health (see Exhibit B: emails to family)
3. Claimed to be the victim of Petitioner's 'false accusations' (see Exhibit C: social media posts)

This DARVO pattern is consistent with the coercive control Petitioner has experienced
throughout the relationship. Expert testimony from Dr. [Name], a DV specialist, confirms
this dynamic."
```

---

#### 6. Prepare for DARVO in Court

**Expect the abuser to**:
- Appear calm, credible, and sympathetic
- Portray you as unstable, angry, or vindictive
- Claim you're the abuser
- Bring "evidence" of your bad behavior (often out of context)

**Counter-strategies**:
1. **Stay calm and factual**: Don't react emotionally
2. **Stick to your timeline**: Refer to documented evidence
3. **Explain context**: If abuser shows "evidence" of you yelling, explain it was self-defense or after years of abuse
4. **Use expert witnesses**: DV therapists can explain reactive abuse, trauma responses, and DARVO
5. **Educate the court**: Provide materials on DARVO if judge is unfamiliar

---

#### 7. Address Common DARVO Claims in Court

| DARVO Claim | How to Counter |
|-------------|----------------|
| "She/he is making false accusations to get custody" | Show abuse timeline predating custody dispute; provide evidence of abuse; highlight that you delayed reporting due to fear |
| "I'm the victim of her/his abuse" | Provide context (self-defense vs. primary aggression); show pattern of your victimization; expert testimony on reactive abuse |
| "She/he is mentally unstable" | Medical records showing trauma-related mental health issues caused by abuse; therapist testimony; character witnesses |
| "She/he is alienating the children from me" | Show children's fear is based on witnessed abuse, not your influence; provide evidence of children's direct experiences |
| "I'm being falsely accused" | Extensive documentation; third-party witnesses; pattern of behavior; consistency of your reports over time |
